In a file called grocery.py, implement a program that prompts the user for items,
one per line, until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program).
Then output the user’s grocery list in all uppercase, sorted alphabetically by item,
prefixing each line with the number of times the user inputted that item.
No need to pluralize the items. Treat the user’s input case-insensitively.

first   -   ask user    for input.
store   the input   in  a   list
count   the number  of  times   the string  is  inputed to  display it  in  the output  to  avoid   repetition
create  an  empty   dict    to  store   the grocceries
